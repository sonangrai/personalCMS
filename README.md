# Personal CMS

Personal CMS is a custom content management system which lets you manage your personal porfolio website contents. I made this so that I can manage my personal porfolio, resume and articles with my own system.

The system is being build in <b>NODEjs</b> backend and the frontend is thought to be made in <b>NEXTjs</b>. For the database <b>mongoDB</b> is used.
